            "content": ". Something similar can be found in retinas of most vertebrates: a &quot;low-level&quot; neural structure receiving visual information and immediately feeding back to the retina without involvement of &quot;high-level&quot; regions. Although in some groups this centrifugal visual system (it&#39;s called that because the information flows not just from the retina[to the center] but also back to the retina[from the center]) consists of barely a handful of neurons;;;;, other animals have developed a much more sophisticated wiring, possibly pointing to a vital role it may play in their case. . The most developed centrifugal visual system known is found in granivorous (i.e. seed-eating) birds. In their case, the role equivalent to the spinal cord is played by a small structure called the isthmooptic nucleus (ION) located very close to the optic tectum (OT);;;;, the most basic visual structure in birds. This proximity is not accidental because ION completely depends on OT for its input. According to our current best knowledge the process looks something like this: . When retina detects a fast moving shadow-like shape in the lower visual field, it sends this information to the OT. | The OT relays it to the ION. | The ION projects back to the same retina but to its ventral part, observing the upper visual field - sky, not the ground, like the part that initiated the loop. | Specialised cells;;;;;;;;;;;;;; in the ventral retina project to the cells in the dorsal retina, thus closing the entire loop. | . What could possibly be the function of this strange loop? Since these birds often fall prey to aerial predators (such as eagles), some researchers suggested that it may be an &quot;early warning system&quot;. The dorsal retina detects a fast moving shadow - a sign of some object directly above, possibly a danger. The loop allows it to inform the ventral retina to scan the corresponding region of the sky in search for a predator which may have cast this shadow. At the same time, the intra-retinal connection allows both retinal halves to coordinate and efficiently look for signs of danger in the sky as well as on the ground. . If this hypothesis is true, the retina-OT-ION-retina loop would be one of the most interesting examples of how the nervous system can fine-tune to the particular demands of the environment of the species - in this case, the high likelihood of falling prey to a predator hunting from the sky. .

            "title": "Seeing as a snake",
            "content": "Some snakes see the world differently than we do. And I don&#39;t mean &quot;just&quot; seeing with a different color palette or processing visual information in different parts of the brain$^1$. Some snakes, specifically pit vipers (like rattlesnakes) and several kinds of constrictors (such as boas and pythons) literally see not only with their eyes but also with pairs of tiny holes located on the front of their skulls. . These holes are facial pits–unique sensory organs specialized for remote sensing of temperature. Imagine being able to feel the precise temperature of an object from several meters away, just by looking at it. That&#39;s what two groups of snakes, Crotalinae (pit vipers, which include rattlesnakes) and Boidae (boids, which include some of the largest and the heaviest living [as well as some extinct] species of snakes) are capable of. What&#39;s interesting is that these two taxa evolved basically the same infrared-sensing organs independently of one another, giving as yet another example of convergent evolution. . Despite many similarities, facial pits of boids and pit vipers differ considerably. First, they differ in number and size. Pit vipers have one big facial pit at each side of the skull, located between the nostril and the eye (they are called loreal pits), whereas boids have three or more pairs of pits lining up their lips (therefore called labial pits from Latin labium meaning &quot;lip&quot;) and their pits are smaller than those of their Crotalinae cousins$^2$. Further differences can be seen in the inside. In both lineages the pit consists of a chamber with sensory membrane, densely innervated and vascularized. The membrane is sensitive to the most subtle changes in the chamber air temperature (as little as $0.001^ circ C$)$^1$. Because the chamber is shielded quite well from the external environment, its temperature can be raised only via infrared radiation coming from the object that the snake currently &quot;looks&quot; at with its pit. . A temperature change triggers an electric impulse which travels via the trigeminal nerve to the central nervous system. However, once the membrane&#39;s temperature has been raised, it now needs to be cooled down, which is achieved differently by pit vipers and boas$^2$. In pit vipers, the membrane is suspended between two separate chambers so that after being heated by the temperature change in the anterior chamber (open to the external environment) it can be quickly cooled down by slightly colder air from the posterior chamber (lacking contact with the external environment). In boas, this is not possible, since their sensory membranes are not suspended between the two chambers but rather line up the posterior wall of a single chamber1. Therefore they need to rely on blood supply for cooling down the membrane, bringing it back to the &quot;default&quot; temperature of the organism as approximated by the temperature of the blood. . Once the temperature change is detected it travels, both in Crotalinae and Boidae, to the optic tectum$^1$–main visual center in the brains of birds2 and reptiles (although serves only a secondary role in visual processing in human brains). On the way, we can see one more difference between the two lineages: in boas, the signal is sent straight to the optic tectum whereas in pit vipers it is relayed via a small nucleus reticularis caloris of the medulla. It&#39;s worth mentioning that the nerve which transmits the IR information is the trigeminal nerve which in humans (and, as far as I know, all vertebrates) transmits predominantly the somatosensory information from the face and innervates the jaw muscles. The part that in pit vipers and boids adapted to transmitting IR information detaches from the remaining part (which on its own connects to somatosensory and motor nuclei) to join the optic tectum. In my opinion, it is a beautiful example of how the nervous system can evolve and adapt to the everchanging demands of the environment. . What&#39;s even more remarkable is how smoothly this infrared information integrates with the visual stimuli from the eyes. Many cells in the optic tectum are bimodal visuo-thermal neurons, sensitive to both the &quot;visible&quot; light and the infrared radiation coming from a particular place in the field of view$^1$. Some of them respond only when both kinds of stimuli are present, for some either one is enough, yet another types of neurons respond to visual stimuli but get silenced by a thermal stimulus (or vice versa). This deep visuo-thermal integration is maintained and relayed to the downstream visual areas to which the optic tectum projects. . From this we can assume with relatively high degree of certainty that snakes see not just with their eyes but also with their facial pits. . All snakes lead a predatory lifestyle, so it&#39;s not surprising that they use thermoception to hunt warm-blooded prey such as mammals and birds. Indeed, some experiments shown that even a blind rattlesnake can hunt somewhat succesfully relying on its facial pits alone$^3$. However, this is not the only way they can be useful. At least some species of rattlesnakes use them for regulating their body temperature, which they achieve mostly by relocating from a place that is too hot or too cold to one where the temperature is closer to optimal. However, their facial pits are only sensitive to temperature changes of the moving objects. How then do they see the temperature of the stationary environment? Well, they move it themselves, or more precisely, create a relative motion with scanning head movements$^1$. . 1. Maybe boas could not evolve suspended membranes (as rattlesnakes did) simply because they had not had enough space in their pits to divide them into two separate chambers (which are smaller than those of rattlesnakes).↩ . 2. It birds it has grown so much that it is often called the visual lobe although, unlike lobes in the human brain, it is a part of the midbrain (mesencephalon) and not the cerebral cortex.↩ .
