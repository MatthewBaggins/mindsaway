<p>For the last few weeks I've been going through the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ">Training Regime Sequence</a>, 5 days per week. Yesterday I processed <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/bh9gAZTmGyJ4j7h2L">Day 20: OODA Loop</a>.</p>
<p>In short, OODA Loop is a simple algorithm/(C)TAP/mental habit, which helps you appropriately react to different situations. You <strong>Observe</strong> - take information from the environment. Then you <strong>Orient</strong> yourself in this environment, i.e. use that information to find possible actions. Then you <strong>Decide</strong> which one is best (i.e. has the <em>expected utility</em> according to some specified goal) and <strong>Act</strong>. Hence, <strong>OODA</strong>.</p>
<p>Each one of these seems obvious. They are obvious. Even linking them in this order may seem obvious. Nevertheless, it is an incredibly useful concept to have available in the back of your mind and teaching your unconscious to implement this algorithm whenever you find yourself in a novel situation can be immensely helpful.</p>
<p><em>(The entire sequence contains many such things that seem obvious but which we tend to use less often than it would be optimal)</em></p>
<p>But the most important thing (to point out) about the <strong>OODA loop</strong> is the fact that <em>it is a loop</em>. You do not stop and rest on laurels after <em>acting</em>. You repeat the loop. You <strong>observe</strong> again to assess how well the outcome matches your preference, re-<strong>orient</strong> yoursel... rinse and repeat until you run out of resources or decide that it's good enough.</p>
<p>If I had to represent this as a piece of code, it <strong><em>wouldn't</em></strong> look like this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/bh9gAZTmGyJ4j7h2L#Failures">Later</a> in the post, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/mark-xu">Mark</a> enumerates through 8 common modes of failure people commit when implementing OODA (which we all do to some extent, whether we have this concept or not). The last one is the least obvious and also the one I'm most prone to: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/bh9gAZTmGyJ4j7h2L#Failure_in_Act____Observe">Failure in Act -&gt; Observe</a>. My planning accuracy has been getting much better over the last few months but I still tend to overestimate how much I can do in a given timespan (especially I tend to neglect the possibility of random events reducing my ability to concentrate, e.g. all of a sudden I need to babysit my 4 year old brother). The most intuitive reaction for me is to tighten up and press the <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-6-stop-pressing-the-try-harder-button">Try Harder Button</a>, but this rarely works and when it does, it often makes me exhausted and thus the overall result is net worse, once I take into account my subjective well-being. The better response (actually, the only sensible alternative) would be to <strong>repeat the loop</strong>. I <strong>observed</strong>, <strong>oriented</strong>, <strong>decided</strong>, and <strong>acted</strong>, but my initial plan didn't survive the contact with reality.</p>
<p>You press <strong>act</strong>.</p>
<p>If you succeed, awesome.</p>
<p>If you don't succeed. Don't keep pressing <strong>act</strong>, because it's highly likely that the plan was flawed.</p>
<p>Repeat the loop. Re-<strong>observe</strong>. Re-**o</p>

<p>Some snakes see the world differently than we do. And I don't mean "just" seeing with a different <a href="https://www.biosphereonline.com/2016/09/06/snake-vision-what-do-snakes-see/">color palette</a> or processing visual information in different parts of the brain$^1$. Some snakes, specifically pit vipers (like rattlesnakes) and several kinds of constrictors (such as boas and pythons) literally <em>see</em> not only with their eyes but also with pairs of tiny holes located on the front of their skulls.</p>
<p>These holes are <strong>facial pits</strong>–unique sensory organs specialized for remote sensing of temperature. Imagine being able to <em>feel</em> the precise temperature of an object from several meters away, just by looking at it. That's what two groups of snakes, <em>Crotalinae</em> (pit vipers, which include rattlesnakes) and <em>Boidae</em> (boids, which include some of the largest and the heaviest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_snakes">living</a> [as well as some <a href="https://youtu.be/T-hDNbM-WLk">extinct</a>] species of snakes) are capable of. What's interesting is that these two taxa evolved basically the same infrared-sensing organs independently of one another, giving as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_examples_of_convergent_evolution">yet another example</a> of <em>convergent evolution</em>.</p>
<p>Despite many similarities, facial pits of boids and pit vipers differ considerably. First, they differ in number and size. Pit vipers have one big facial pit at each side of the skull, located between the nostril and the eye (they are called <strong>loreal pits</strong>), whereas boids have three or more pairs of pits lining up their lips (therefore called <strong>labial pits</strong> from Latin <em>labium</em> meaning "lip") and their pits are smaller than those of their <em>Crotalinae</em> cousins<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228022254/http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100314/full/news.2010.122.html">$^2$</a>. Further differences can be seen in the inside. In both lineages the pit consists of a chamber with sensory membrane, densely innervated and vascularized. The membrane is sensitive to the most subtle changes in the chamber air temperature (as little as $0.001^\circ C$)$^1$. Because the chamber is shielded quite well from the external environment, its temperature can be raised only via infrared radiation coming from the object that the snake currently "looks" at with its pit.</p>
<p>A temperature change triggers an electric impulse which travels via the trigeminal nerve to the central nervous system. However, once the membrane's temperature has been raised, it now needs to be cooled down, which is achieved differently by pit vipers and boas<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228022254/http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100314/full/news.2010.122.html">$^2$</a>. In pit vipers, the membrane is suspended between two separate chambers so that after being heated by the temperature change in the anterior chamber (open to the external environment) it can be quickly cooled down by slightly colder air from the posterior chamber (lacking contact with the external environment). In boas, this is not possible, since their sensory membranes are not suspended between the two chambers but rather line up the posterior wall of a single chamber<sup id="fnref-1" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Therefore they need to rely on blood supply for cooling down the membrane, bringing it back to the "default" temperature of the organism as approximated by the temperature of the blood.</p>
<p>Once the temperature change is detected it travels, both in <em>Crotalinae</em> and <em>Boidae</em>, to the optic tectum$^1$–main visual center in the brains of birds<sup id="fnref-2" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> and reptiles (although serves only a secondary role in visual processing in human brains). On the way, we can see one more difference between the two lineages: in boas, the signal is sent straight to the optic tectum whereas in pit vipers it is relayed via a small <em>nucleus reticularis caloris</em> of the medulla. It's worth mentioning that the nerve which transmits the IR information is the <strong>trigeminal nerve</strong> which in humans (and, as far as I know, all vertebrates) transmits predominantly the somatosensory information from the face and innervates the jaw muscles. The part that in pit vipers and boids adapted to transmitting IR information detaches from the remaining part (which on its own connects to somatosensory and motor nuclei) to join the optic tectum. In my opinion, it is a beautiful example of how the nervous system can evolve and adapt to the everchanging demands of the environment.</p>
<p>What's even more remarkable is how smoothly this infrared information integrates with the visual stimuli from the eyes. Many cells in the optic tectum are bimodal visuo-thermal neurons, sensitive to both the "visible" light and the infrared radiation coming from a particular place in the field of view$^1$. Some of them respond only when both kinds of stimuli are present, for some either one is enough, yet another types of neurons respond to visual stimuli but get silenced by a thermal stimulus (or <em>vice versa</em>). This deep visuo-thermal integration is maintained and relayed to the downstream visual areas to which the optic tectum projects.</p>
<p>From this we can assume with relatively high degree of certainty that <strong><em>snakes see not just with their eyes but also with their facial pits</em></strong>.</p>
<p>All snakes lead a predatory lifestyle, so it's not surprising that they use thermoception to hunt warm-blooded prey such as mammals and birds. Indeed, some experiments shown that even a blind rattlesnake can hunt somewhat succesfully relying on its facial pits alone$^3$. However, this is not the only way they can be useful. At least some species of rattlesnakes use them for regulating their body temperature, which they achieve mostly by relocating from a place that is too hot or too cold to one where the temperature is closer to optimal. However, their facial pits are <em>only sensitive to temperature changes of the moving objects</em>. How then do they see the temperature of the stationary environment? Well, they move it themselves, or more precisely, create a relative motion with scanning head movements$^1$.</p>
<p><div class="footnotes"><p id="fn-1">1. Maybe boas could not evolve suspended membranes (as rattlesnakes did) simply because they had not had enough space in their pits to divide them into two separate chambers (which are smaller than those of rattlesnakes).<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnote footnotes">↩</a></p></div>
<div class="footnotes"><p id="fn-2">2. It birds it has grown so much that it is often called the <strong>visual lobe</strong> although, unlike lobes in the human brain, it is a part of the midbrain (<em>mesencephalon</em>) and not the cerebral cortex.<a href="#fnref-2" class="footnote footnotes">↩</a></p></div></p>
