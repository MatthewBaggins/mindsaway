<p>Some snakes see the world quite unlike we do. However, I'm not speaking about having more types of cones and therefore seeing more colors (although snakes do have four cone types and therefore are tetrachromatic). I'm also not speaking about differences in the visual processing in the brain (although the structure which in snakes does most of the work serves only a secondary role in human brains). Some snakes, specifically pit vipers (like rattlesnakes) and several kinds of constrictors (such as boas and pythons) literally <em>see</em> not only with their eyes but also with pairs of tiny holes located on the front of their skulls.</p>
<p>These holes are aptly named <strong>facial pits</strong> and are unique sensory organs specialized for remote temperature sensing. Imagine being able to <em>feel</em> the precise temperature of an object from the distance of several meters, just by looking at it. That's what two groups of snakes, <em>Crotalinae</em> (pit vipers, which include rattlesnakes) and <em>Boidae</em> (boas, which include some of the largest and the heaviest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_snakes">living</a> [as well as some <a href="https://youtu.be/T-hDNbM-WLk">extinct</a>] species of snakes) are capable of. What's interesting is that these two taxa evolved basically the same infrared-sensing organs independently of one another, giving as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_examples_of_convergent_evolution">yet another example</a> of <em>convergent evolution</em>. Even more remarkable, it seems that only among boas facial pits were invented independently more than once.</p>
<p>Despite many similarities in facial pits of pit vipers and boas, there are also gross differences. First, the number and the size. Pit vipers have one big facial pit at each side of the skull, located between the nostril and the eye (they are called <strong>loreal pits</strong>). Boas, on the other hand, have three or more pairs of pits lining up their lips (therefore called <strong>labial pits</strong> from Latin <em>labium</em> - "lip") smaller than those of their <em>Crotalinae</em> cousins. Greater differences can be seen inside the organ. In both lineages it consists of a chamber with sensory membrane, densely innervated and vascularized. The membrane is sensitive to the most subtle changes in temperature of the air in the chamber (as little as $0.001^\circ C$). Because the chamber is shielded quite well from the external environment, its temperature can be raised only via infrared radiation coming from the object that the snake currently "looks" at with its pit.</p>
<p>The change in temperature triggers the electric impulse that is then sent to the central nervous system. However, once the membrane was heated, it now needs to be cooled down, which is achieved differently by pit vipers and boas. In pit vipers, the membrane is suspended between two separated chambers so that after being heated by the change in the temperature of the anterior chamber (open to the external environment) it can be quickly cooled down by slightly colder air from the posterior chamber (lacking contact with the external environment). In boas, this is not possible, because their sensory membranes are not suspended between the two chambers but simply line up the posterior wall of a single chamber<sup id="fnref-1" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Therefore they need to rely on blood supply for cooling down the membrane, bringing it back to the "default" temperature of the organism as approximated by the temperature of the blood.</p>
<p>Once the temperature change is detected it travels, both in <em>Crotalinae</em> and <em>Boidae</em>, to the optical tectum, which is the main visual center in the brain for birds<sup id="fnref-2" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> and reptiles (although serves only a secondary role in visual processing in human brains). On the way, we can see one more difference between the two lineages: in boas, the signal is sent straight to the optic tectum whereas in pit vipers it is relayed via a small <em>nucleus reticularis caloris</em> of the medulla. It's worth mentioning that the nerve which transmits the IR information is the <strong>trigeminal nerve</strong> which in humans (and, as far as I know, all vertebrates) transmits predominantly the somatosensory information from the front of the skull (which we humans call the face) and innervates the jaw muscles. The part that in pit vipers and boids adapted to transmitting IR information detaches from the rest (which on its own connects to somatosensory and motor nuclei) to join the optic tectum. In my opinion, it is a beautiful example of how the nervous system can adapt to the everchanging demands of the environment.</p>
<p>What's even more remarkable is how smoothly this infrared information integrates with the visual information coming from the snake's eyes. Many cells in the optic tectum are bimodal visuo-thermal neurons, sensitive to both the "visible" light and the infrared radiation coming from a particular place in the field of view. Some of them respond only when both kinds of stimuli are present, for some either one is enough, yet another types of neurons respond to visual stimuli but get silenced by a thermal stimulus (or <em>vice versa</em>). This deep visuo-thermal integration is maintained and relayed to the downstream visual areas to which the optic tectum projects.</p>
<p>From this we can assume with relatively high degree of certainty that <strong><em>snakes see not just with their eyes but also with their facial pits</em></strong>.</p>
<p>All snakes lead a predatory lifestyle, so it's not surprising that they use this information predominantly to hunt the warm-blooded prey such as mammals and birds. Indeed, some experiments shown that even a blind rattlesnake can hunt somewhat succesfully relying on its facial pits alone. However, this is not their only possible use. At least some species of rattlesnakes use them for regulating their body temperature, which they achieve mostly by relocating from a place that is too hot or too cold to one where the temperature is closer to optimal. However, their facial pits are <em>only sensitive to temperature changes of the moving objects</em>. How then do they see the temperature of the stationary environment? Well, they move it themselves, or more precisely, create a relative motion with scanning head movements.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><p id="fn-1">1.

<div class="footnotes"><p id="fn-2">2.

</h2>
<p>Animals see the world in very different ways. Even among mammals we see some variability. Our trichromatic vision, constituted by three kinds of cone receptors, fine-tuned to respond to the wavelengths of 430, 540, and 570 nanometers (blue, green, and red light, respectively) is typical only for our species and our closest primate cousing. Most mammals are dichromatic - they possess two-color vision, due to having only two types of cones in their retina. This is what we usually mean when we say that a person is "color-blind" - it's not that their world is painted with gray scale, it's just that they lack one kind of three photoreceptors responsible for color vision.</p>
<p>Interestingly, individual species differ quite considerably with regards to the fine-tuning of their photoreceptors. Rats, for example, have short-wavelength cones (which in us humans would be responsible for blue-color vision) fine-tuned to a slightly shorter wavelengths, allowing them to see ultraviolet. Also, some mammals completely "sacrificed" their color vision in exchange for better night vision - the space freed up by the elimination of their retinal cones was repopulated by rods (the other kind of retinal photoreceptor) endowing them with greater sensitivity to very dim light. This is what happened to whales, sirenians (such as dugongs and manates), pinnipeds (seals, walruses, and their kin) or even some nocturnal primates, like aye-aye.</p>
<p>Even <strong><em>more interestingly</em></strong> mammalian dichromatism is not an ancestral condition. The ancestors of mammals were, like most non-mammalian vertebrates, tetrachromatic, i.e. they had four types of cones in their retinas and thus perceived four primary colors. Early in mammalian history, during the reign of dinosaurs, our ancestors were rather small animals, hiding in the bushes, and were active mostly during the night (<em>nocturnal</em>) or twilight (<em>crepuscular</em>) so they did not need very detailed color vision and thus got by quite well with only two types of cones. The value of trichromatic vision was rediscovered only relatively recently by (at least) three groups of primates (apes, including humans, consitute one of them) who found it very useful for finding ripe fruits among the canopy.</p>

</h3>
<p>But sometimes there's more to seeing than just eyes. And no, I don't mean either the third (so called <em>parietal</em>) eye of tuataras, nor secondary eyes (so called <em>ocelli</em>) of many arthropod species. Some species of snakes, for example rattlesnakes, can perceive infrared, a part of the electromagnetic spectrum especially useful for remote sensing of temperature of objects (the higher the temperature of an object, the more infrared it emits). As all snakes are predators, it's not a hard guess that they use it mainly to find warm-blooded prey, such as mammals.</p>
<p>To see the infrared, rattlesnakes do not rely on their retinas. They have developed specialized organs called <strong>facial pits</strong> which are two small apertures located between a nostril and an eye on each side of the head. These are basically pinhole cameras, with back walls lined up with free nerve endings responding to very minor changes in temperature: a rattlesnake can detect a temperature change as small as $0.001^\circ$C (one-thousandth of a degree Celsius). Isn't it remarkable that such a simple biological device can be so sensitive?</p>
<p>But what's even more remarkable is that this thermoreceptive organ is completely integrated with rattlesnake's visual system. Signals from its nerve endings travel via trigeminal nerve, the biggest of the cranial nerves which in humans deals mostly with transmitting somatosensory information from our face as well as innervating the muscles of our jaws. In rattlesnakes however, the fibers that transmit the thermal/infrared information from the facial pits detaches from the rest of the trigeminal nerve and connects to the <strong>optic tectum</strong> - the main visual center of the reptilian brain. There we can find (many other types of neurons) bimodal thermo-visual neurons, which respond both to visual and thermal stimuli coming from the same place in the visual field.</p>
<p>The integration doesn't end here either. The bimodal neurons of the rattlesnake's optic tectum pass this integrated information further, to other visual brain structures So we can safely say that the thermoreceptive facial pits and rattlesnake's eyes constitute one integrated system and not with the eyes alone the rattlesnake sees the world.</p>
<p>However, there is one important caveat here. For some reason, facial pits "see" only moving stimuli, they are completely indifferent to the differences in temperature of the static objects. This may have been an additional evolutionary pressure for rattlesnake's potential warm-blooded prey (like rodents or possums) to develop an automatic freeze response in the presence of a predator. But hunting it isn't just hunting that rattlesnakes uses its infrared sensing for. As endotherms they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their temperature, so it makes sense for them to use employ it for seeking warm places. Of course, nice, sun-warmed places usually do not move very much. Rattlesnakes deal with it in a clever way, to see the temperature of static objects, they move them themselves, or rather their images. By moving their head left and right, they create relative motion, thus making the unseen static objects visible to their facial pits.</p>
